Class::Constructor::Factory - Automated constructor generation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Class::Constructor::Factory; # exports defer and lazy
  BEGIN {
    @ISA = qw( Class::Constructor::Factory );
  }

  __PACKAGE__->mk_constructor0({
    magical_number   => 42,
    timestamp => defer { DateTime->new },
  });
  # the weird name, mk_constructor0, is on purpose while API settles

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  NOTE: This module is about to be renamed. 

I like the simplicity of L<Class::Accessor> and friends. 
With them, creating accessors is a piece of cake.
It does give me a default constructor as well.

The case is that this default constructor is not 
as convenient as the generated accessors. To be precise,
I want to specify default values for attributes
easily. This module is a tentative solution to this problem.
